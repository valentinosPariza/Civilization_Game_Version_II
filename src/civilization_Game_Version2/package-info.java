 *This program has the same purpose as the second programming exercise.To be more specific it is the same.Although in 
 *this programming exercise, our task as programmers is to find the importance of using inheritance as a technique
 *for solving multiple problems which require object oriented programming.So in this program the technique of 
 *inheritance is used in order to break the problem into sections and the sections into more simple sections.As I 
 *describe again in some superclasses ,the method of inheritance can help as create some classes which at future 
 *can be used to expand the program.There are much more classes than the previous exercises.The classes are:
 * {@linkplain civilization_Game_Version2.Building}
 * {@linkplain civilization_Game_Version2.CoalMine}
 * {@linkplain civilization_Game_Version2.Desert}
 * {@linkplain civilization_Game_Version2.Egypt}
 * {@linkplain civilization_Game_Version2.Fish}
 * {@linkplain civilization_Game_Version2.Game}
 * {@linkplain civilization_Game_Version2.Hills}
 * {@linkplain civilization_Game_Version2.Population}
 * {@linkplain civilization_Game_Version2.QinDynasty}
 * {@linkplain civilization_Game_Version2.River}
 * {@linkplain civilization_Game_Version2.RomanEmpire}
 * {@linkplain civilization_Game_Version2.Settlement}
 * {@linkplain civilization_Game_Version2.Strategy}
 * {@linkplain civilization_Game_Version2.Technology}
 * {@linkplain civilization_Game_Version2.Treasury}
 * {@linkplain civilization_Game_Version2.CivilizationGame}
 * {@linkplain civilization_Game_Version2.Civilizations}
 * {@linkplain civilization_Game_Version2.Food}
 * {@linkplain civilization_Game_Version2.Resources}
 * {@linkplain civilization_Game_Version2.Terrains}
 * {@linkplain civilization_Game_Version2.Victories}
